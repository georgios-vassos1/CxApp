* Interaction between Server and Client

** Server Setup
   - The server initializes a socket and binds it to a specified port.
   - It listens for incoming connections from clients.

** Client Connection
   - The client establishes a connection to the server by specifying the server's IP address and port number.

** Data Exchange
   - Once the connection is established, the client sends a message to the server.
   - The server receives the message from the client.
   - Upon receiving the message, the server processes it (in this case, simply printing it).
   - The server then sends a response back to the client, acknowledging the message receipt.

** Connection Termination
   - After the data exchange is complete, both the client and server close their respective sockets, terminating the connection.
