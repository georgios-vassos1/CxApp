* Explanation of Behavior

** Two Processes:
   - The program uses `fork()` to create a child process from the parent process. This results in two separate processes running concurrently.
   - The parent process and the child process both have access to the pipe file descriptors, allowing them to communicate via the pipe.

** Parallel Execution:
   - After `fork()`, both the parent and the child processes run in parallel, meaning they execute their code simultaneously (though the exact scheduling is managed by the operating system).

** Pipe Creation:
   - The `pipe(pipefd)` function call creates a unidirectional data channel (pipe) with two file descriptors: `pipefd[0]` for reading and `pipefd[1]` for writing.

** Blocking Read:
   - The child process closes the write end of the pipe (`pipefd[1]`) and attempts to read from the pipe (`pipefd[0]`).
   - Since no data has been written to the pipe and the write end is still open (by the parent), the `read` call blocks, waiting for data to be written.

** Writing to the Pipe:
   - The parent process closes the read end of the pipe (`pipefd[0]`).
   - After a delay (to demonstrate the blocking), the parent writes data ('x') to the pipe (`pipefd[1]`), unblocking the child's `read` operation.

** End of File (EOF):
   - If the write end of the pipe were closed without writing any data, the `read` call in the child process would return 0, indicating EOF.

*** Key Details:

- `fork()` Function: Creates a new process (child) that runs concurrently with the parent process. Both processes have separate memory spaces but share open file descriptors.
- Blocking Behavior of `read`: When `read` is called on an empty pipe with the write end open, it blocks until data is available.
- Pipe File Descriptors: `pipefd[0]` is for reading and `pipefd[1]` is for writing. Closing the unused ends in each process prevents deadlocks and ensures proper synchronization.
- Concurrency: Although the processes run in parallel, synchronization (e.g., the child waiting for the parent to write data) is crucial for correct operation.
- EOF Condition: The `read` call returns 0 when the write end of the pipe is closed and no more data is available, signaling EOF.

*** Summary

In this example, the parent and child processes communicate through a pipe. The child process attempts to read from the pipe and blocks until the parent writes data to it. This demonstrates the blocking nature of the `read` operation on an empty pipe and the inter-process communication facilitated by pipes in Unix-like systems.
